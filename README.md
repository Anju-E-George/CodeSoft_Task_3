Iris Flower Classification
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset is widely used for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.
Features:
- Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn.
- Preprocesses the data by splitting it into features and target variable, and scaling the features.
- Uses logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to train the model.
- Evaluates the model's performance using a classification report and a confusion matrix.
Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
Usage:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script `iris_classification.py`.
4. View the classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
